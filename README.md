# 🐾 Cat Parade Box

**A chaotic Chrome extension full of running cats and endless meowing.**  
Built originally as a joke project in under an hour — but somehow became *too good to delete*. 😺

## 🎮 What It Does
Click the extension icon and unleash a floating box full of animated cats!  
- 🐈 Cats run across the screen and meow when clicked  
- 🎵 Loops a playful background song (with a mute toggle)  
- 🖱️ Draggable, resizable floating box  
- 💖 Optional donation links for cat treats (PayPal / BTC / ETH)  

It’s pure nonsense — and that’s exactly the point.
